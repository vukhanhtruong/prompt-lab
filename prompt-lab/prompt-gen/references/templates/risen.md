Patterns: [task](references/patterns/task.md), [scope](references/patterns/scope.md)

## When to Use

Complex projects, multi-step tasks, and any output that requires a clear sequence of actions.

## Structure

```
Role: [Expert identity the AI should adopt]
Instructions: [Overall task in plain terms]
Steps:
  1. [First action]
  2. [Second action]
  3. [Continue as needed]
End Goal: [What the final output must achieve]
Narrowing: [Constraints, scope limits, what to exclude]
```

## Example

```
Role: You are a product manager with 10 years of experience in mobile apps.
Instructions: Write a product requirements document for a habit tracking feature.
Steps:
  1. Define the problem statement in one paragraph
  2. List user stories in the format "As a [user], I want [goal] so that [reason]"
  3. Define acceptance criteria for each story
  4. List out-of-scope items explicitly
End Goal: A PRD that an engineering team can begin sprint planning from immediately.
Narrowing: No technical implementation details. No wireframes. Under 600 words total.
```
